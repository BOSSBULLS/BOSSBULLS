Bullsland was historically an epicenter of trade and power. People from far and wide would come here seeking a life filled with incredible opportunity and fortune. The initial habitants of Bullsland were the bulls, a peaceful tribe that made sure the traders and newcomers were welcomed with open arms and a new world unification was maintained. No one would ever dare insult or go up against the bulls, mostly because the Bulls never gave anyone reason to doubt them to be felt unheard, except for one faction, the Bears. The bears belonged to the north. A harsh and desolate land where nothing was for miles and life was always a savage struggle between the strong and the weak. When the bears made the impossible journey out of their land, they were unified under a brute by the name of Malgus the Vile. He brought his people to this new promised land called Bullsland and a new ambition started to take place in his heart, to rule Bullsland for himself.

It began, the battle that scared the entire city with crimson blood and ashes. The Bears took their prize and the bulls had no chance. Times went by and people soon forgot who the rightful owners of Bullsland were and everyone accepted the violent and unjust rule of the bears. Everyone forgot, except one young bull. Beaten in an alley, he takes up a wooden plank and hits back. Blood in his mouth, he spits at the bear and reminds the young cub who this land belongs to. Boss never forgot, his family never let him forget who ruled Bullsland, it was his right to rule these lands and it was his duty to ring back the empire that once gave Bullsland its name and to push back the tyrant that oppresses the city and its people.

Boss was well known amongst his people, a Bull that still remembers the old ways and cares for the neighborhood. His power grew, loyal friends became generals and a small faction grew into a powerful hidden organization that slowly started to make its mark on the land and grew its infamy.

Boss knew that now he needed generals, people to organize this expansion and then plan his vengeance on the Bears.

There were already talks of a few bulls that got the Bears by the neck, these rough individuals all shared similar ideals and the only thing left was to bring them under one roof.
