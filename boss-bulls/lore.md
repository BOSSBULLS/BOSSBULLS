# üåç Lore

Bullsland has a massive and rich history. Its ecosystem revolves around ancient magic as a secret source that only those that have passed away and lost to the scriptures of history have known. There is a Runesmith who knows these secrets well but after reaching them, he realized that it is best to keep them a secret to the world that has now detached from and is now thriving in its inexistence. From a famous city that is the central hub of Buillsland, it also stretched to vast mountain peaks, then to valleys and dense forests, to desert lands that are uninhabitable and belong home to the vilest of creatures. The city is the main place where the People of Bullsland reside. It is huge beyond all measure and unified as kept by the Old Bull Emperors of the land, they kept trade and stability and unity among all the people of Bullsland.
